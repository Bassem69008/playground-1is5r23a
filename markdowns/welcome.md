# Welcome!

This PHP template lets you get started quickly with a simple working example in PHP. If this is your first contribution, you should have a look at the [Getting Started](https://tech.io/doc/getting-started-create-playground) guide.


The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/TechDotIO/php-template), please feel free to come up with proposals to improve it.

# Hands-on Demo

@[Luke, how many stars there are in these galaxies?]({"stubs": ["Universe.php"], "command": "/bin/bash run.sh"})

# Template Resources

[`markdowns/welcome.md`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/php-template/blob/master/markdowns/welcome.md)  
What you are reading here is generated by this file. Tech.io uses the [Markdown syntax](https://tech.io/doc/reference-markdowns) to render text, media and to inject programming exercises.


[`php-project`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/php-template)  
A simple PHP project dedicated to run the programming exercise above. A project relies on a Docker image. You can find images on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/) or you can even [build your own](https://tech.io/doc/reference-runner).


[`techio.yml`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/php-template/blob/master/techio.yml)  
This *mandatory* file describes both the table of contents and the programming project(s). The file path should not be changed.


# Visual and Interactive Content

Tech.io provides all the tools to embed visual and interactive content like a Web app or a Unix terminal. Please refer to the [documentation](https://tech.io/doc) to learn more about the viewer integrations.
